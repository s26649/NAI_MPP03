Limerence is a deep emotional state characterized by an intense desire for a romantic connection with a particular person. Individuals experiencing limerence are often obsessed with that person, constantly thinking about them, and feeling a strong attraction towards them. This attraction can lead to a desire for intimacy and reciprocity in feelings.

Limerence can be accompanied by a wide spectrum of emotional experiences, including euphoria when in the presence of the person of interest, but also deep sadness or anxiety when faced with rejection or a lack of reciprocity in feelings. This can lead to constant emotional tension and anxiety due to fear of losing the loved one or a lack of control over the situation.

Physical symptoms of limerence may include rapid breathing, heart palpitations, sweating, or trembling. Individuals experiencing limerence often describe feeling butterflies in their stomach or excitement when in the presence of the person they are attracted to.

Although limerence can be intense and emotionally draining, some people see it as inspiration for creativity or as motivation for personal development. However, if limerence becomes a barrier to normal functioning or causes significant distress, it is important to seek support and assistance from mental health professionals to find ways to cope with this emotional challenge.
